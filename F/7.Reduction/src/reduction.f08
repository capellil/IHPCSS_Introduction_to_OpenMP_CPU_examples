!> @brief This example is to illustrate the use of a reduction clause.
!> @details You will find two folders in this example, and will in all examples
!> provided in this session:
!> - src: contains the source code.
!> - bin: contains the binary produced.
!> 
!> The makefile provided already sets everything up for you:
!> - To compile: `make`.
!> - To execute: `./bin/reduction`.

!> @brief The objective is for each thread increments a common "thread_count"
!> variable, to manually count the number of threads available.
!> @details To do so, you must use two different approaches, without relying on
!> the use of a barrier or critical construct.
